Wonderland is a strange place. There is a wonderland number that is also quite strange.

You must find a way to generate this wonderland number.

- It has six digits
- If you multiply it by 2,3,4,5 or 6, the resulting number has all the same digits in it
  as the original number. The only difference is the position that they are in.
