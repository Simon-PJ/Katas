# String Sum Kata

- Write a simple String Sum utility with a function *string Sum(string num1, string num2)*, which can accept 
  only natural numbers and will return their sum. Replace entered number with 0 (zero) if entered number is
  not a natural number. A natural number is a positive integer including 0.
