# Odd Even Kata #

- [Link](https://github.com/garora/TDD-Katas/blob/master/KatasReadme.md#the-oddeven-kata)
- Write a program that prints numbers within a specified ranges, say 1 to 100. If number
  is odd print 'Odd' instead of the number. If the number is even print 'Even' instead of the number.
  Else print the number [hint - if number is prime]

- Steps
    - Prints numbers from 1 to 100
    - Print "Even" instead if number if the number is divisible by 2
    - Print "Odd" instead of the number if the number is not divisible by two and is not prime
    - Print number is it is prime
    - Make method accept any number of range instead of 1 to 100
    - Create a new method to check odd/even/prime for a single supplied number
